# Bitcoin Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project develops a predictive model for Bitcoin prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a special kind of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The model aims to predict future Bitcoin prices based on historical data, demonstrating the application of deep learning techniques in financial markets.

## Description
The project uses LSTM to handle the sequence prediction problem inherent in time series data like stock prices. LSTMs are well-suited for making predictions based on time series data due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies.

## Installation
``bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/btc_price_prediction_lstm.git
cd btc_price_prediction_lstm
pip install -r requirements.txt
